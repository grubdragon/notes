Trading NQH2022
Look at the weekly, and focus your analysis on what is the market drawing to?
Drawing to = likely movement higher or lower.
Set your initial bias through the Weekly chart
Now move to 1D to find liquidity, majority of the movers are found predominantly on this time frame
Liquidity101
> Market draws to either stops (which is liquidity) or it is running to an imbalance
> Above old highs - buy stops, Below old lows - sell stops
> Imbalance : Also called fair value gap, when two candles, before and after a current one, have highs and lows separated i.e. there is distance between the wicks of the two candles
Now that we are done with daily, we move to 1h/15m chart
> Anytime you expect a move lower, expect buy stops begin taken out i.e. stop-hunting of existing sellers, with stop loss at previous highs
> Vice-versa a short term low will be taken out before a rally
Check 1h/15m charts and see what's going on in these charts. Mark out the different sell and buy stops and watch what's happening, there must be some grabbing of liquidity on this chart. Once you see the liquidity pools grabbed, time to go to 1m/2m/3m chart(3m is the highest TF at which algorithms work...mostly they work on 1m or 30s or 15s charts. On 5m there is still possibility of some imbalances being formed internally)
On 1m/2m/3m charts we are now looking for some specific signature, i.e. an imbalance formed towards your market bias, right at the stophunt of 15m

> Discount and Premium levels: Take the day's range so far, and draw a 50% box, anything above 50% is referred to as a premium level, and anything below that is referred to as a discount level
