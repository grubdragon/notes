### Chapter 3 : Defining and Generating Sleep
Identifying sleep seems trivial due to our experience, but these are done by the following characteristics:
1. Sleeping organisms have a stereotypical sleeping position
2. Lowered muscle tone (postural muscles ease and take shape of surface beneath)
3. No overt display of response/communication
4. Easily reversible
5. Sleep adheres to patterns

Sleep can also be self-assessed. We use two ways
1. **Loss of external awareness:** Sensory organs eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin still send signals to the thalamus(in the brain). Thalamus sits like a perceptual barricade: it blocks sensory information in sleep. If they do get through, they reach the cortex.
2. **We lose track of time:** Explicit sense of time is lost. Further, in dreams, time is dilated. However note that your subconscious mapping of time remains precise (eg. you wake at 5:58am when you want to wake up at 6 to catch a flight). This mapping is not available to the conscious.
